# HiveSkill

(Not to be confused with [skill-hivemind](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/skill-hivemind), the Mycroft Skill that works like HiveMind-core)

---
A module to help HiveMind devices *do stuff*. At the node side, this module's namesake class serves the same purpose as a Mycroft Skill. At Mycroft's end, Skills can import this module to interface with connected devices. HiveMind-compatible Mycroft Skills can specify corresponding HiveSkills for devices to run.
